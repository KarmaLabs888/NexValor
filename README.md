*Nex Valor* is an advanced trading strategy that integrates multiple technical indicators to create a comprehensive and adaptive trading system. By combining MACD, RSI, SMA, and SuperTrend, this strategy aims to identify optimal trading opportunities *by considering market trends, momentum, and volatility*.

Uses and Objectives

*Detect Market Trends*: SMA (Simple Moving Average) is used to determine the long-term and short-term market direction.

*Measure Momentum*: MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) assesses the strength of the current trend.

*Evaluate Market Conditions*: RSI (Relative Strength Index) helps identify overbought or oversold conditions to avoid false signals.

*Set Entry and Exit Points*: SuperTrend and ATR (Average True Range) are used to establish adaptive stop loss and take profit levels based on market volatility.
Application in Different Conditions

Bullish Trends (Rising Market)

Entry: Look for buy signals when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, RSI is below the overbought level, the price is above SMA 50 and SMA 200, and the SuperTrend direction indicates a bullish trend (positive).

Exit: Exit the position when the initial buy signal starts to weaken, using stop loss and take profit levels based on ATR.
Bearish Trends (Falling Market)

Entry: Look for sell signals when the MACD line crosses below the signal line, RSI is above the oversold level, the price is below SMA 50 and SMA 200, and the SuperTrend direction indicates a bearish trend (negative).

Exit: Exit the position when the initial sell signal starts to show potential reversal, using stop loss and take profit levels based on ATR.
Sideways Market (No Clear Trend)

Entry: In a sideways market, this strategy may be less effective. Focus on more conservative signal settings and be cautious of false signals.

Exit: Adjust stop loss and take profit levels tightly to avoid significant losses.
